# Phased Implementation Plan

This plan sequences the Node/TypeScript rewrite into phases that each end with working, demoable software. Every phase lists objectives, relevant design documents/sections, acceptance criteria, and a reminder that tests are authored at the start to cover the criteria.

> **Note**: Full details for completed phases are archived in [ROADMAP-COMPLETED.md](./ROADMAP-COMPLETED.md).

## Completed Phases Summary

### Phase 1: Bootstrap CLI & Runtime Skeleton - COMPLETE 2025-11-29

Delivered minimal Node-based CLI with scope detection and bootstrap sequence. Key outcomes:

- Event Model types (`SidekickEvent`, `HookEvent`, `TranscriptEvent`) in `@sidekick/types`
- Type guards for event discrimination
- `HandlerRegistry` interface wired into `RuntimeContext`
- CLI detects user vs project scope via `--hook-script-path` argument

### Phase 1.5: UI Foundation - COMPLETE 2025-11-29

Built monitoring UI infrastructure. Key outcomes:

- Log parsing (NDJSON reader, session filtering, log merging)
- Replay Engine with time-travel state reconstruction
- Shared types between UI and backend packages
- Event type badges and source indicators

### Phase 2: Configuration & Asset Resolution - COMPLETE 2025-11-30

Implemented configuration cascade with YAML domain files. Key outcomes:

- 4 domain files: `config.yaml`, `llm.yaml`, `transcript.yaml`, `features.yaml`
- 7-layer cascade: defaults → env → user unified → user domain → project unified → project domain → project-local
- `sidekick.config` unified override support (dot-notation)
- Derived path helpers for staging directories
- Breaking change: flat config → domain-based (`config.core.logging.level`, etc.)

### Phase 3: Structured Logging & Telemetry - COMPLETE 2025-11-30

Added two-phase logging pipeline. Key outcomes:

- Split log files: `cli.log` / `supervisor.log`
- `source` field distinguishing CLI vs Supervisor
- `ContextLogger` with deep-merge context
- 8 logging event types (HookReceived, HookCompleted, ReminderStaged, etc.)
- UI wired to read real logs with filter/search capabilities

### Phase 4: Core Services & Providers - COMPLETE 2025-12-01

Built LLM providers, TranscriptService, and StagingService. Key outcomes:

**4.1 RuntimeContext Discriminated Union**: `CLIContext | SupervisorContext` with type guards, service interfaces in `@sidekick/types`

**4.2 TranscriptService Foundation**: Expanded `TranscriptMetrics` schema with token usage, cache tiers, per-model breakdown

**4.3 TranscriptService Implementation**: File watching (chokidar), incremental processing, compaction detection, metrics persistence

**4.4 StagingService**: Atomic file staging, suppression markers, sync/async APIs

**4.5 Integration & Verification**: End-to-end tests for Feature → LLM flow, TranscriptService → Handler flow, credential precedence

**4.6 UI Integration**: MetricsPanel with sparklines, Compaction Timeline markers, StateInspector tabs, API endpoints for session data

- [ ] **Phase 7: Monitoring UI Completion & Hardening**
  - [ ] Objectives
    - [ ] Close remaining gaps against `packages/sidekick-ui/docs/MONITORING-UI.md` so the UI is truly usable for time-travel debugging (not just log viewing).
    - [ ] Replace mock-only state inspection with real, compaction-aware, replay-derived state inspection.
    - [ ] Make the Monitoring UI runnable outside Vite dev mode (production-local runtime) while preserving dual-scope behavior.
    - [ ] Improve performance and robustness for large sessions/logs.
  - [ ] Execution model
    - [ ] Top-level groups 7.A → 7.E are sequential. Subtracks within each group can be done concurrently.
  - [ ] Relevant documents/sections
    - [ ] `packages/sidekick-ui/docs/MONITORING-UI.md` (§3.1 Compaction Timeline, §3.2 Time Travel, §5 Unified Cockpit)

    - [ ] `{project_root_dir}/docs/design/SUPERVISOR.md` (§4.6 Heartbeat Mechanism)
  - [ ] Acceptance criteria (applies to all sub-phases)
    - [ ] UI can be launched in a “real logs” mode and all panels are backed by real data (no hard-coded mock state except in an explicit demo mode).
    - [ ] Time travel changes the inspected state deterministically (scrubbing produces consistent snapshots).
    - [ ] Compaction markers and snapshot viewing work for multi-compaction sessions.
    - [ ] Large log files remain usable (no multi-second UI freezes on refresh/poll).
    - [ ] All tests pass and no lint/typecheck warnings.
  - [ ] **7.A Contracts & Data Surfaces (must complete before 7.B)**
    - [ ] **7.A.1 API endpoints: session state & stage reading** (parallel)
      - [ ] Add/finish endpoints to read inspector-backed data:
        - [ ] `.sidekick/sessions/{sessionId}/state/session-summary.json`
        - [ ] `.sidekick/sessions/{sessionId}/state/session-state.json` (if present)
        - [ ] `.sidekick/sessions/{sessionId}/stage/{hookName}/*.json` and suppression markers
    - [ ] **7.A.2 Request/response contracts in `@sidekick/types`** (parallel)
      - [ ] Define stable response schemas for the UI (state domains, staged reminders, compaction metadata as needed).
    - [ ] **7.A.3 Validation & security hardening** (parallel)
      - [ ] Validate/sanitize all path parameters (`sessionId`, `hookName`, filenames) to prevent traversal.
      - [ ] Dual-scope resolution tests (project vs user) and missing/empty file cases.
  - [ ] **7.B Real State Inspector (Replay-Driven)**
    - [ ] **7.B.1 Wire replay engine into UI state selection** (parallel)
      - [ ] Replace `stateData` mock plumbing with replay-derived snapshots keyed by time.
      - [ ] Use `TimeTravelStore` / replay timeline as canonical “state at time”.
      - [ ] Ensure staged reminders (`stage/{hookName}`) and summary state participate in replay state.
    - [ ] **7.B.2 Generic JSON tree viewer (read-only)** (parallel)
      - [ ] Replace `session-summary.json`-specific rendering with a generic inspector for arbitrary JSON.
    - [ ] **7.B.3 Snapshot diff view (generic, computed)** (parallel)
      - [ ] Implement a computed diff view between consecutive snapshots (Git-style), not hard-coded field diffs.
    - [ ] **7.B.4 Tests** (parallel)
      - [ ] State reconstruction correctness, snapshot selection by scrub position, diff calculation correctness.
  - [ ] **7.C Unified Cockpit UX Parity (Spec Alignment)**
    - [ ] **7.C.1 Time-cut indicator in stream** (parallel)
      - [ ] Add the time-travel “current time indicator” that visually cuts the stream at the selected timestamp.
    - [ ] **7.C.2 Click-to-snap from stream events** (parallel)
      - [ ] Make stream items clickable to snap time (not only the timeline rail).
    - [ ] **7.C.3 Live vs paused mode behavior** (parallel)
      - [ ] Ensure “Live” mode follows new events and reliably returns to “paused” when user scrubs.
    - [ ] **7.C.4 Search UX alignment** (parallel)
      - [ ] Ensure search (filters + free-text) operates on displayed event content per spec intent.
  - [ ] **7.D Performance & Reliability for Large Sessions**
    - [ ] **7.D.1 Incremental ingestion (avoid full re-parse)** (parallel)
      - [ ] Stop re-parsing full logs on every poll; use a cheap “mtime-only” check and/or incremental fetch behavior.
      - [ ] Use the existing streaming NDJSON parser for incremental ingestion.
    - [ ] **7.D.2 Robustness guardrails** (parallel)
      - [ ] Edge cases: 0–1 events (timeline math), missing timestamps, malformed NDJSON lines.
    - [ ] **7.D.3 Focused perf regression tests/benchmarks** (parallel)
      - [ ] Lightweight perf coverage (no external API calls).
  - [ ] **7.E Production-Local Runtime (Beyond Vite Dev Middleware)**
    - [ ] **7.E.1 Node server: serve built SPA + `/api/*`** (parallel)
      - [ ] Provide a Node runtime that serves the built UI and hosts the same API endpoints.
    - [ ] **7.E.2 CLI entrypoint** (parallel)
      - [ ] Add `sidekick ui` (or similar) to launch server and open/print the URL.
    - [ ] **7.E.3 Dual-scope verification** (parallel)
      - [ ] Verify path resolution in both `.sidekick/` and `~/.sidekick/` contexts.
    - [ ] **Verification gate**: `pnpm build && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test`

    - [ ] `{project_root_dir}/docs/design/flow.md` (complete hook flows as feature reference)
  - [ ] **8.1 Legacy Audit**
    - [ ] Audit `benchmark-next/` for unported features (early TypeScript exploration, largely stale)
    - [ ] Audit `src/sidekick/` (bash runtime) for behaviors not yet in TypeScript packages
    - [ ] Audit `scripts/` for analysis tools that should migrate (e.g., `analyze-session-at-line.sh`, `simulate-session.py`)
    - [ ] Audit transcript processing logic

    - [ ] Asset bundling: copy `assets/sidekick/` to installed location
    - [ ] Dual-scope detection: warn when both user and project hooks are installed
    - [ ] CLI commands: `sidekick install --project`, `sidekick install --user`, `sidekick uninstall`
  - [ ] **9.2 Config Migration**
